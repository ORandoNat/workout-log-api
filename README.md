# Workout Log API

## Description
The Workout Log API is a full‑stack fitness tracking application that allows users to securely log workouts, track progress, and manage their training history. It includes a complete authentication system, protected API routes, and a lightweight frontend built with vanilla JavaScript. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, and is fully prepared for deployment on Render.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend root with the following values:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development

These variables are required for both local development and production.
Do not commit your real `.env` file — it should remain in `.gitignore`.

For deployment (Render), set the same variables in the Render dashboard under:
Settings → Environment → Environment Variables

## Why This Stack?

This project uses a simple, reliable stack designed to stay easy to understand while still supporting real-world features like authentication, protected routes, and persistent data storage.

Node.js and Express provide a lightweight, flexible backend for building RESTful APIs. MongoDB and Mongoose offer a schema‑driven, scalable database layer that works well for user accounts and workout data. The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript to keep the interface fast, dependency‑free, and easy to maintain.

The goal is clarity, not complexity — a clean full‑stack foundation that can grow without becoming overwhelming.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed
- A MongoDB Atlas connection string (MONGO_URI)

(Optional)  
If you prefer running MongoDB locally instead of using Atlas, you may install and run a local MongoDB server.  
Just update your `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file to point to your local instance.

## Getting Started

## Getting Started

If you want to get the project running quickly, here’s the short version:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ORandonat/workout-log-api.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd workout-log-api

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install

4. Create a `.env` file with your MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET values.

5. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

For full setup details, see the “Running Locally” section below.

---

## Running Locally

### 1. Install dependencies
npm install

### 2. Create a `.env` file in the project root
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
NODE_ENV=development

### 3. Start the development server
npm run dev

The server will start on the port defined in your `.env` file (default: 4000).

### 4. Open the app in your browser
http://localhost:4000

You can now sign up, log in, and manage workouts using the local backend and frontend.

## Usage

Whether you're running the app locally or using a deployed version, the workflow is the same:

- Create an account or log in with an existing one.
- Add new workouts by entering a name and an amount (reps or minutes).
- Optionally include notes or select a custom date and time.
- View your full workout history in a clean, sorted list.
- Edit any workout to update its details.
- Search workouts by keyword to quickly find past entries.
- Delete workouts you no longer need.

All workout actions are protected and require a valid logged‑in session.

---

## API Endpoints

Below are the available API routes for authentication and workout management.
Authentication routes are public, while workout routes require a valid JWT.

### Auth

#### Sign up  
**POST** `/api/user/signup`  
Body:  
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

#### Log in
**POST** `/api/user/login`
Body:  
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Successful login returns a JWT used to access protected workout routes.

### Workouts (Protected)

#### Get all workouts
**GET** `/api/workouts`

#### Get a single workout
**GET** `/api/workouts/:id`

#### Create a new workout
**POST** `/api/workouts`
Body:
```json
{
  "name": "Push-ups",
  "amount": 20
}
```

#### Update a workout
**PATCH** `/api/workouts/:id`
Body (any field optional):
```json
{
  "name": "Sit-ups",
  "amount": 30
}
```

#### Delete a workout
**DELETE** `/api/workouts/:id`

## Current Limitations

- Some elements do not have label attributes, which limits accessibility.

---

## Roadmap

### Completed
- Add user authentication (sign up, login, protected routes)

### Planned
- Add workout categories and filtering
- Add pagination for large workout histories
- Add sorting options (date, name, duration)
- Add data visualization (charts for workout trends)
- Add mobile-friendly UI improvements
- Add automated tests (unit, integration, and API)
